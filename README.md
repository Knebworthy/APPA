## Automatic Partition-based Parallel Algorithm

Automatic partition-based parallel algorithm (APPA) is a parallel algorithm that helps maximum the performance of parallelization of grid-based distributed models. To use it, you may need a explicit understanding of the grid-based hydrological model that need parallelization. APPA is still developing. If any question arise, please feel free to contract the developer xuzhw5@mail2.sysu.edu.cn for further guidance/communication. 

## Parallelization

Since current APPA do not support importing local flow direction, users can only used the single flow routing (D8 algorithm) with the first three CPP files to get the flow table generated by D8 algorithm. Furtherly, we will change the I/O of APPA to make it suitable for other produced single flow direction images. Meanwhile, the source code is now compiled in VS2019.  Later, we will move the sources code to a single directory. 

According to the reference, there are four parameters in APPA, *D*, *xita_s*, *xita_g* and *Tcg*. You can keep the parameters as they are or try to change them. 

We also prepare to publish a R package of APPA (in plan, depended by responses from community). 

## Coding practice in modelling

The output of APPA stores in  ".sthread " and ".cthread" file (txt file) to indicate the sub-basin ID and channel unit ID. Specifically, the channel units ID need to be parsed, as it is composed with layer ID and 3-digit unit ID in that layer. For example, 12056 stands for "layer 12 unit 056".  In specific, you can get the two ID by following equations.

```C++
unitID  = inputChannelID % 1000 // get remainder
layerID = (inputChannelID - unitID) / 1000
```

Here we provide a C++ version of pseudo code to illustrate the coding practice for models. You can simulate the grid one-by-one in ithread_grid_array, jlayer_ithread_grid_array in each time scale. For example, recursively run it for daily simulations. 

```C++
// start of daily simluation
import_grid_array();
import_parallel_images();
    
// hillslope processes 
#pragma omp parallel for schedule (static, 1) num_threads(nthread) 
for (ithread = 0; ithread < nthread; ithread ++) {//nthread is the number of threads
	parallel_hillslope_daily (ithread_grid_array); // grid array that stores addresses of grids
}
// channel processes
for (jlayer = 0; jlayer < nlayer; jlayer++){//nlayer is the number of layers
	#pragma omp parallel for schedule (static, 1) num_threads(nthread) 
	for (ithread = 0; ithread < nthread; ithread ++) {//nthread is the number of threads
		parallel_channel_daily(jlayer_ithread_grid_array);// grid array that stores addresses of grids
	} 
}
// end of daily simluation
```
